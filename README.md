# Association for Pathology Informatics R Workshop

This introductory R workshop aims to teach participants with minimal programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed squarely at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data. 

- Instructors: 
  * Daniel Herman
  * [Stephan Kadauke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skadauke/)
  * Patrick Mathias
  * Amrom Obstfeld
  * Joseph Rudolf
 

## Pre-course work/requirements

- A laptop (macOS, Windows, or Linux) with WiFi
  - Please confirm you can connect to the conference WiFi prior to class
- Please complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [API R Workshop Participant Survey](https://forms.gle/Xe3U71ZBZRmrP2E87)
- The program that we will be using to interact with R during the course is called RStudio. We will be using a cloud based RStudio server, hosted at [RStudio.Cloud](Rstudio.cloud), in our workshop. Our intent in using a cloud-based platform to minimize possible in-class setup issues.
- Please follow the instructions in [this presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amromeo/api_r2019/master/00 - Setup_Cloud_Account.pptx) to setup an [RStudio.Cloud](Rstudio.cloud) account. 
- As the date of the conference approaches, we will be sending out a web link that will grant access to the workshop project within RStudio.Cloud. 
- While not required we **highly** recommend installing RStudio Desktop on your laptop as well. See instructions below.

### Installing RStudio onto your own computer

Working with our cloud based RStudio instance will be the most straightforward way to proceed through the workshop. However, in the long term, you will need R and RStudio installed on your own computer in order to work on private or PHI containing data. You can find a video with step by step instructions for installing on Mac or PC by following the links below:

- [macOS Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g) 
- [Windows Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)

Please complete each step in the video in turn including the final step, installing the tidyverse packages.

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

There are multiple ways to access and interact with the course content, depending on whether you choose to proceed through the workshop using the cloud based RStudio or one on your own laptop. 

1. If you choose to use the the cloud based RStudio instance, all the course content will be pre-loaded. 
2. If you would prefer to run RStudio on your own computer:
   * download the course material from the course github [repository](https://github.com/amromeo/api_r2019) as a \*.zip file from [here](https://github.com/amromeo/api_r2019/archive/master.zip) 
   * Unzip the file to a convenient location (your desktop or documents folder)
   * When you open RStudio, set this location as your working directory 

## The day of the workshop

The workshop is scheduled to begin at 8 am sharp. In order to make sure that we can begin on schedule please make every effort to arrive 10 - 15 minutes early to allow time to get settled, get your laptop set up, and get RStudio up and running.

## Acknowledgments

All of the course instructors have previous experience implementing and executing R workshops at a variety of venues. The workshop we are presenting for the API community is in many ways a product of these past experiences. The workshop also integrates content, best practices, and lessons from a variety of educators in the R community. We would like to specifically acknowledge:
