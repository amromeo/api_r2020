# Association for Pathology Informatics R Workshop

This introductory R workshop aims to teach participants with minimal programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed squarely at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data.

## Pre-course work/requirements

- A laptop (macOS, Windows, or Linux) with WiFi
- Preferably two monitors (or two laptops), one for the Zoom conference software, and one in which you will work.
- We will be utilizing Zoom Meeting for this workshop, please download and install the latest version [here](https://zoom.us/download)
- The program that we will be using to interact with R during the course is called **RStudio**. We will be using a cloud based version of RStudio, hosted at [RStudio.Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), in our workshop.
- Please follow the instructions in [this presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hlPMuN_drjwbX4idk_H2A7imPjWPhoSN/view?usp=sharing) to setup an [RStudio.Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account. 
- *Note: Some older internet browsers may not be compatible with RStudio.cloud. See [this web page](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/227449447-Supported-browsers-for-RStudio-Connect) for additional information.*
- As the date of the conference approaches, we will be sending out a web link that will grant access to the workshop project within RStudio.Cloud. 
- While not required, we **highly** recommend installing RStudio Desktop on your laptop as well. See instructions below.
- Please complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [API R Workshop Participant Survey](https://forms.gle/Xe3U71ZBZRmrP2E87)**Need to update


### Installing RStudio onto your own computer

Working with our cloud based RStudio instance will be the most straightforward way to proceed through the workshop. However, in the long term, you will need R and RStudio installed on your own computer in order to work on private or PHI containing data. You can find a video with step by step instructions for installing on Mac or PC by following the links below:

- [macOS Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g) 
- [Windows Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)

Please complete each step in the video in turn including the final step, installing the tidyverse packages.

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

There are multiple ways to access and interact with the course content, depending on whether you choose to proceed through the workshop using the cloud based RStudio or one on your own laptop. 

1. If you choose to use the the cloud based RStudio instance, all the course content will be pre-loaded. 
2. If you would prefer to run RStudio on your own computer:
   * Download the course material from the course github [repository](https://github.com/amromeo/api_r2019) as a \*.zip file from [here](https://github.com/amromeo/api_r2019/archive/master.zip) 
   * Note: As the course material will be periodically updated, please wait until the week prior to the conference to dowload the zip file
   * Unzip the file to a convenient location (your desktop or documents folder)
   * When you open RStudio, set this location as your working directory 
   * If this all sounds too complicated - go back to option 1!

## A note on the mechanics and etiquette of the virtual workshop
Please note that this is first virtual R workshop that our team is hosting, we are preparing extensively to ensure that the workshop is productive for you, however some technical challenges are to be expected
* The workshop's platform will be Zoom Meeting.
* Please refrain from screen grabbing other users information or from recording the workshop.
* The workshop will be recorded in its entirety
* All 5 instructors will have the role of moderator during the workshop, 1 will be presenting while the other 4 field questions.
* 

## Prior to the workshop
* Expect an email from API approximately 1 week prior to the workshop
* This will contain a link to the Zoom conference from which we will be hosting the workshop

## The day of the workshop

The workshop is scheduled to begin at 1 pm ET. In order to make sure that we can begin on schedule please make every effort to log into the Zoom conference 10 - 15 minutes early to allow time to get settled, ensure your laptop is set up, and get RStudio up and running.

## Acknowledgments

All of the course instructors have previous experience implementing and executing R workshops at a variety of venues. The workshop we are presenting for the API community is in many ways a product of these past experiences. The workshop also integrates content, best practices, and lessons from a variety of educators in the R community. We would like to specifically acknowledge:
